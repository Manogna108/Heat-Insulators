                <h3> As mentioned before in the Inspiration page, our main focus is to create a heat insulator that takes the indoor thermal energy, provided from a heater and reuses that same air to keep 
                the house warm. Initially, the original product was known as a thermal insulator. The heat insulator is an advanced modification of the original one. Before, you would have to turn on the 
                insulators every time that you wanted the house to heat up. From now on, once the temperature is below 60 degrees, the insulator will automatically start to
                run, and it will keep the house nice and warm for the whole day. Once it hits 70 degrees or above it automatically turns off. This new invention is a huge benefit for many people, because one, it significantly costs less than most heating systems, two, 
                it reduces the number of times you have to turn the switch on and off, and three, the insulating system is completely eco-friendly. Unlike the previous product our heat insulator runs on batteries
                which only have to be changed every 6 months if you are a frequent user. The insulator is combined with a regular light. The bottom half is the light while the top part is the 
                heater. On the sides there will be ventors that allow air to pass in and out. The materials we will use are  aluminum foil to allow heat to be transferred and liquid refrigerant outside the foil.
                These materials helps the product take in heat from warmer areas of the house and release it in cooler areas. The new heat insulators are meant to be a low-priced 
                product, which interests potential investors as they tend to look towards progressive technologies. Our product will be sold at a price range of around 250 dollars which may seem like it is too much money
                for a low income household. As result we offer a solution by giving the buyer a choice, they can either pay everything in a single payment or pay in monthly interest. They only have to pay 10 dollars
                every year for the next 25 years. This way they are able to use the product with having to worry about financial issues.
