                <h3> Imagine a situation where in mid-winter you have to get up to do your everyday chores. It is below 40 degrees fahrenheit and your sweater is not able to keep you warm. As a result, 
                to keep yourself warm you turn on the heater. But what if the temperature remains cold the whole day? If you make less than 50k per year, leaving the heater on for the whole day is not 
                something you can afford. This is when our product comes in. We decided to create a product called heat insulators that would help you keep your house warm the whole day after turning on 
                your heater for less than an hour. You might ask, why not just buy a heat pump that can be used in summer and winter? Even though, it is true that heat pumps are very functional in saving 
                energy and money during winters and summer, they cost around 3000 dollars per set. This is too expensive for a low income household. This is why we thought that if we could create a product 
                that is cheap and effective for winters, many people don't have to spend thousands of dollars and at the same time can stay nice and warm.
